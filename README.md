## 🧠 Overview  

**R.E.P.O.** is a cooperative horror title centered on extraction missions where planning and restraint matter more than firepower. Teams are deployed into hostile locations to secure objectives and escape intact, all while managing noise, visibility, and limited information.

Each run demands careful coordination. Seemingly small actions can escalate danger, forcing squads to adapt quickly when threats react to movement or sound. The game’s structure promotes deliberate pacing and shared decision-making rather than solo heroics.

Minimal interface elements and dimly lit spaces amplify tension, keeping players alert and vulnerable. With dynamic encounters and varied layouts, every mission unfolds differently, encouraging repeat play and refined teamwork.

R.E.P.O. focuses on compact, nerve-wracking sessions built around cooperation and calculated risk.
